CODES AND VISUALIZATIONS:
This folder consists of codes, visualizations and pickled datasets for angle determination 
of the three objects(Mug, Mouse, Stapler).

It also consists of a code for object recognition. Due to large size of the pickled dataset 
for this part of the project, it(the pickled dataset) has not been included in the submission.

SAMPLE DATASET:
This folder is a small subset of the original tabletop dataset found online, to give
an idea of the data used.

WEIGHTS FOR MODELS(hdf5) FOR THREE OBJECTS:
This folder consists of hdf5 files which hold the weights of the best
performing model for determination of orientation of the three different
objects(one hdf5 file for each). It was obtained by running the codes under the
folder CODES AND VISUALIZATIONS.


NOTE: ALL CODES ARE USING TENSORFLOW BACKEND
